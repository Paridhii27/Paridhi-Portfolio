          Our memories are the accumulation of a lifetime of experience and in
          this sense, our memories are who we are. These memories consist of the
          places, people, and things we interact with in our day to day lives.
          “Computerized Memories” is a fictional immersive environment exploring
          the connection between human cognitive memory functions and computer
          memory structures. There are four main themes related to the memory
          functioning of the mind according to cognitive neuroscience research
          which are visualized in this project. These themes are that of
          connection, compartmentalization, cognition and consolidation of
          memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Computerized Memories” begins with a scene focused on a desk,
          surrounded by elements that evoke a person’s memories and daily
          routine. There are pictures on the wall that capture the person’s
          memories from the places they’ve visited to the moments they’ve had
          with their friends and family. The desk itself holds personal items
          like notes, headphones, and other essentials that reflect their daily
          habits. Each object and image is a meaningful connection to the
          person’s lived experiences. The scene is modelled in reference to my
          own room. Sitting on my desk, drawing parallels between my own
          memories, I began thinking how a computer would form its own memories?
          What would the memories of a computer look like? This project explores
          this question in many different ways. Delve into the computerized
          memory world to find about the inner experiences and memories of a
          computer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first scene introduces you to the protagonist of this world. The
          scene depicts a person's desk as described above and their tactile
          memories but as we know the protagonist of the story isn’t the person
          but it is in fact the computer! The experience begins when you enter
          the computer’s brain by clicking on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the computer, the first scene takes the user through a journey
          of traversing a field of cubes which is reflective of the idea of
          memory storage in a computer. The memory is depicted as unnamed
          cubical modules distributed randomly throughout the environment. Using
          python code and random variables the scene is created to visualize the
          theme of compartmentalization. This theme notes how memory can be
          localized to a particular area of the brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the second computerized memory scene explores the theme of
          connection. “A phenomenon of brain cells is that memories are
          instantiated by alterations of the strength or reliability of
          communication between cells via their synaptic connections. This scene
          recreates the circuit connections within the RAM of a computer. Each
          section of the RAM is formed using fractals to create the circuitry.
          The project also reveals itself in bits and pieces as you enter and
          exit portals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the last scene of this interactive experience explores the
          concepts of cognition and consolidation of memories.The computer forms
          memories when it interacts with the user through applications. The
          computer employs audio functionality when the user opens Spotify and
          plays a song.The computer searches across the internet when the user
          asks a question on chrome. It performs mathematical operations on the
          calculator application. So, would the computer be able to do any of
          that if it didn’t have a memory of its own? This goes into the
          psychological aspect of memory analysis. It talks about the theme of
          consolidation which is how memories take permanent form. The
          experience ends kind of abruptly looking at the control center of the
          computer: settings. Leaving a trace of the user's actions on the
          computer's memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          As technology has now become inherent in every aspect of life from
          navigation, health, weather and just about everything else, are we
          losing parts of ourselves to the computer? Where do our memories end
          and where do the computer’s memories begin? Can digital memories ever
          replace cognitive memories?
