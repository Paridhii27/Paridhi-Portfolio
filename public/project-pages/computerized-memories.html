        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Our memories are the accumulation of a lifetime of experience and in
          this sense, our memories are who we are. These memories consist of the
          places, people, and things we interact with in our day to day lives.
          “Computerized Memories” is a fictional immersive environment exploring
          the connection between human cognitive memory functions and computer
          memory structures. Human cognitive memory is multifaceted and complex
          consisting of processes such as the storing and retrieval of
          information. There are four main aspects explaining how memory
          functioning occurs in the mind – connection, compartmentalization,
          cognition and consolidation of memories. This project draws parallels
          between memory functioning in humans and computers through a
          speculative lens.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          It begins with a scene focused on a desk, surrounded by elements that
          evoke a person’s memories in this case my memories. There are pictures
          on the wall that capture the person’s memories from the places they’ve
          visited to the moments they’ve had with their friends and family. The
          desk itself holds personal items like a computer, notes, headphones,
          and other essentials that reflect the person’s daily habits. Each
          object and image is a meaningful connection to the person’s lived
          experiences. The scene is modelled in reference to my own room and
          memories. The scene introduces you to the protagonist of this world.
          The protagonist of the story isn’t the person but it is in fact the
          computer! Sitting on my desk, looking at the photos on my wall one day
          I began thinking how would a computer form its own memories? What
          would the memories of a computer look like? How do human memories get
          translated into digital memories? This project explores these
          questions in many different ways. Delve into the computerized memory
          world to take a look at the inner experiences and memories of a
          computer. Begin by clicking on the computer screen to enter the
          computer’s brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you enter, you start traversing a field of cubes which is
          reflective of the idea of memory storage in a computer. The memory is
          depicted as unnamed cubical modules distributed randomly throughout
          the environment. Using python code and random variables the scene is
          created to visualize the theme of compartmentalization. This theme
          notes how memory can be localized to a particular area of the brain.
          Each memory has its own localized cube.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the second computerized memory scene explores the theme of
          connection. In the human brain, memories are formed through changes in
          the strength or reliability of communication between brain cells,
          which occurs at their synaptic connections. Within a computer this is
          represented by circuit connections within the RAM of a computer. Each
          section of the RAM is formed using fractals. These fractals visualize
          the circuitry of a RAM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final scene of this interactive experience delves into the
          concepts of cognition and memory consolidation. A computer forms
          memories through its interactions with the user across various
          applications. For example, it uses audio functionality when the user
          opens Spotify to play a song, searches the internet when the user asks
          a question on Chrome, and performs mathematical operations through the
          calculator app. But could the computer do any of this without a memory
          of its own?
        </p>
        <p>
          This brings us to the psychological aspect of memory analysis,
          particularly the theme of consolidation—how memories become permanent.
          The experience concludes rather abruptly by focusing on the computer’s
          control center: the settings. It leaves behind a trace of the user’s
          actions imprinted in the computer’s memory.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          To fully understand the gravity of this concept, we also must look
          back at where it all began. Initially, there were human
          computers—individuals who carried out the tedious yet essential
          calculations that drove the advancement of technology. During the
          1960s and 1970s, most human computers were replaced by machine
          computers, bringing in the era of automated computing. Fast forward to
          today, and we see computers embedded in nearly every aspect of life.
          This prompts an important question: how do we navigate the
          ever-blurring boundary between what is human and what is computerized?
          As technology becomes indispensable in areas such as navigation,
          healthcare, weather prediction, education, and countless other
          domains, we are left to wonder—are we losing parts of ourselves to the
          computer? Where do our memories end, and where do the computer's
          memories begin? And perhaps most critically, can digital memories ever
          truly replace the cognitive memories that define our humanity?
        </p>
        <p>
          This reflection on the intersection of technology and memory serves as
          a poignant reminder of the profound ways in which computers are
          reshaping our understanding of what it means to remember, to think,
          and ultimately, to be human. The interactions and 3D environments were
          created using Blender and Unity with the materials rendered through
          node based programming.
