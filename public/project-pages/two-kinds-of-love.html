        <p>It's the year 2065. The world’s environment has deteriorated many folds. A suffocating blanket of smoke is covering the land. Based on your status in society, you are either left to die in the smoke and heat or you get access to the revolutionary AI at the time to create an altered reality for you where you’re living in a utopia.
        </p>
        <p>There are two people who send each other postcards because they can’t see each other. The inherent systems of the society at the time has created physical barriers between them. One of them comes from a well off family while the other person barely has anything to keep them alive.</p>
        <p>Based on this storyline, we started to develop the world of our characters. Asking questions like, How do the characters know each other? How long have they known each other? What is the conflict/ is there one? Where does each character live? “Why is one place considered utopian?Why is the other place considered dystopian?</p>
        <p>After determining what we want the story to be, the next question was about how we can translate all that information in the form of postcards. How many postcards should we make? What is the last postcard? How does the tone change and the narrative arc develops as time goes by? Where are the characters situated when they send different postcards? Since we wanted to create visual scenes of each postcard's environment we divided them into categories. There are three postcards each from both of the characters and one anonymous postcard at the end which the viewer can interpret as being sent by any one of them. There is warmth, love and conflicts intertwined in these postcards.
        </p>
        <P>Lastly, the project was compiled as an archive book with the postcards interspersed with pressed flowers, leaves, images and an artifact. Some of the postcards have a qr stamp on them which takes you to the website which has the embedded environments. It conveys the difference between reality and altered reality because all the pictures the girl sends are dreamy and imaginative while the video shows the blunt truth of the world as flashbacks as the girl blinks.</P>
