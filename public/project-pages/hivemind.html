        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>
          Emergent behavior is inherently based on arrangement of different
          parts within a system, and not on the parts themselves. Our game takes
          this aspect of arrangement of parts to create a conversational game in
          which the players talk to one another guided by certain rules and
          using different prompt cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emergent systems challenge existing notions of reality to bring out
          new ways of thinking. Based on the given prompts the players need to
          decide where they would sequentially fall within the group they are
          playing the game in, and what process the cards are ultimately
          describing.
        </p>
        <h3>Point of View</h3>
        <p>
          The players see the one card they have been dealt, the game guide
          video, and the other players in the game in an open area. All the
          players are free to move around the space without restriction. The
          player’s mental point-of-view is restricted to the information on
          their own card, and the information they can gather based on the other
          player’s acting.
        </p>
        <h3>Perception</h3>
        <p>
          The game world is represented through the means of physical cards.
          Each card describes one step in a six-step process. The game world is
          also represented by the game guide video, which visually communicates
          the game instructions.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          The game is about having clear concise conversations to understand the
          story or role of the other players in order to rearrange yourself.
          Being an effective silent-communicator as well as listener/interpreter
          determines the success of the group in each round.
        </p>
        <h3>Decision making</h3>
        <p>
          The players make decisions about where they would be in a sequence
          based on the other player's silent communication. Players can all
          communicate simultaneously, or one at a time, depending on how the
          group decides to approach the challenge. Each player in this emergent
          system is trying to gain as much information as possible to put the
          details together to form a comprehensive link of how the system is
          interconnected, and communicate those findings to the rest of the
          group. This game is an imperfect information space, as there are many
          restrictions. Players do not know the information on other players
          cards, and they cannot directly/freely communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <h3>Emotions</h3>
        <p>
          We want the game to generate a feeling of playfulness and fun as one
          tries to understand emergent behavior. We also want the game to be
          engaging and easy to play with friends and family.
