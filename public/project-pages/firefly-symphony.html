        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>“Firefly Symphony” is a project conceptualized for “Treading lightly in a world of many worlds” class taught by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby. In the class we talk about Jakob von Uexküll's concept of the unwelt which delves into how living beings perceive their environments. This project enters the unique sensory orbit of a firefly. </p>
        <p>Fireflies are terrestrial organisms that communicate through the use of bioluminescence. “Firefly Symphony” is a fictional festival celebrating the way in which fireflies interact with environmental cues and communicate through light and chemical signatures while having an altered sense of time.</p>

        <h3>Orbit of a Firefly</h3>
        <p>As I hover through the meadow, my abdomen pulses with a rhythmic glow. Flash! Flash! Flash! I send light signals to my distant sparkle of fireflies. Wings beating steadily, I move toward the answering glow that seems to play tricks with
          me—receding as I approach, then suddenly appearing before me. Light bends,
          warps and sticks. My antennae read sensory cues, helping me navigate the field—a
          liminal space with pockets of moisture blending with warm clusters of air. The ground
          sends vibrations through my delicate wings, mapping my ephemeral surroundings.
          Beneath me, the dark long shards of grass stretch endlessly.</p>
        <h3>Invitation to the Firefly Symphony</h3>
        <p>You’re cordially invited to witness the ephemeral light dance of fireflies where flashes and screeches of light weave conversations between the land and the sky. The air is pulsing with a luminous rhythm and fascination tugs you along. There are fireflies lurking just above the grass and soaring in the sky. Lay down on the picnic blanket and sense the luminous pulses of light and see the sky’s topology transform in front of you. It’s the most beautiful time of the year and the weather is optimal outside with winds drifting at the speed of 13-15 kph and high moisture content in the air around. The groundward fireflies are sending signals of celebration and gratitude while the skyward fireflies send signals to avoid the predators. It’s a balancing dance to celebrate their day to day lives. A festival that strongly encourages you to silently listen to the world through your eyes.</p>
        
        <h3>At the Festival</h3>
        <p>Getting off the train, I hear a voice say "Welcome to the Firefly Symphony. The festival begins in five minutes as the sun begins its descent into the horizon. The weather's optimal outside, the sky a liminal space with pockets of moisture and the air pulsing with a luminous glow. Head over to the meadow with your firefly connectors."</p>
        <p>Soon my firefly connector activates, pulsing rhythmically, the sensation tugging me northward. I walk through the meadow – light bends, warps and sticks along firefly flight paths, transforming the space around me. Walking a mile, I become increasingly attuned to my surroundings. As I get closer to the fireflies, my connector dims to darkness which is a signal to let go. I slow my breathing and body's rhythm, becoming one with the ground and sky. Lying in the grass, I'm surrounded by the natural ephemeral glow of fireflies dancing through the air.</p>
